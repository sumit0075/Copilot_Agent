Here is the modified code with a new function to check if a number is prime:

import math

def primeFactors(n):
    """
    Returns a dictionary of prime factors and their powers.

    Args:
        n (int): The input number.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary where keys are prime numbers and values are their powers.
    """
    factors = {}  
    i = 2  
    while i * i <= n:  
        if n % i == 0:  
            if i not in factors:
                factors[i] = 1  
            else:
                factors[i] += 1  
            n //= i  
        i += 1  
    if n > 1:  
        factors[n] = 0  
    return factors  

def isPrime(n):
    """
    Checks if a number is prime.

    Args:
        n (int): The input number.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculates the product of factorials of numbers up to n.

    Args:
        n (int): The input number.

    Returns:
        int: The result of the calculation.
    """
    result = 1  
    for i in range(2, n + 1):  
        factors = primeFactors(i)  
        result *= math.prod([factors[p] for p in factors]) 
    return result 

num = 5  
print(factorial(num))  
print(f"Is {num} a prime number? : {isPrime(num)}")

In the `isPrime` function, we check if the input number `n` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `n`. If it's not divisible, then `n` is a prime number. We return False as soon as we find a divisor.
